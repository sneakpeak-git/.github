## Setting up the project

All apps and services in this project use **Node.js** and **Yarn** to run. You can set them up by following these steps:

## 1. Install Node.js

- Open your terminal.
- Check if Node.js is already installed by running:
    ```
    node --version
    ```
- If a version number is returned, you have Node.js installed. If not, you can install Node.js. For Linux distributions like Ubuntu, you can use:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    ```
  On MacOS, you can use Homebrew:
    ```
    brew install node
    ```
  For Windows, you can download an executable installer from the Node.js website.

## 2. Install Yarn

- In your terminal, check if Yarn is already installed by running:
    ```
    yarn --version
    ```
- If not, you can install it using npm (which is installed along with Node.js):
    ```
    npm install --global yarn
    ```

## 3. Set Up Your Project

- Check out app specific instructions on their respective branches.

Note that these instructions will be updated as the project expands.
